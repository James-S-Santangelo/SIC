### Abstract

A growing body of evidence suggests that natural populations can evolve to
better tolerate the novel environmental conditions associated with urban
areas. Invariably, studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas examine only
one or a few traits at a time from populations residing only at the most
extreme urban and nonurban habitats. Thus, whether urbanization is driving
divergence in many traits simultaneously in a manner that varies with the
degree of urbanization remains unclear. To address this gap, we generated seed
families of white clover (Trifolium repens) collected from 27 populations
along an urbanization gradient in Toronto, Canada, and grew them up to measure
multiple phenotypic traits in a common garden. Overall, urban populations had
later phenology and germination, larger flowers, thinner stolons, reduced
cyanogenesis, greater biomass, and were more attractive to pollinators.
Pollinator observations revealed near complete turnover between urban and
nonurban sites, which may explain some of the observed divergence in floral
traits and phenology. Our results suggest that adaptation to urban
environments involves multiple organismal traits.
