## Sex and the City
#### Authors: James S. Santangelo, Ken A. Thompson, Carole Advenard, and L. Ruth Rivkin

This repo contains code and data associated with a project testing the effects of urbanization on plant sexual and asexual reproduction in the model system white clover (_Trifolium repens_). The experiment has two questions:

1. Does urbanization alter relative investment in sexual vs. asexual reproduction?
2. Is urbanization associated with variation in plant phenological and reproductive traits?
